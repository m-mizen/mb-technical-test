/*
This component displays the details of a single product.

I am using the <details> and <summary> HTML elements to provide a native and accessible way to show/hide the product details.
If I'm honest, this is the first time I've used these elements, and I think they are a great addition to HTML5. There are some limitations, such as the lack of control over the summary marker (the little arrow), but for this use case, they work well.
In a real world, I would probably use a more custom solution to have more control over the styling and behavior, but given the time constraints, this is a good compromise.
